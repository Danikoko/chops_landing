							<li>
								<h3 style="font-size: 150%;">ABOUT CHOPS</h3>
								<p class="justify-sm">Chops is a web-based mobile application operated by Chops Limited, 
									incorporated and registered in Nigeria, whose registered office is at 
									2nd Floor, St. James House, 167 Ademola Adetokunbo Crescent, Wuse, Abuja, 
									FCT. Chops is a food delivery business where the food is prepared by 
									independent restaurants (our "<b>Partner Restaurants</b>") and delivered by us.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3 style="font-size: 150%;">ACCEPTANCE</h3>
								<p class="justify-sm"> By downloading and using our app or the website you acknowledge that 
									you ("<b>you</b>", "<b>your</b>" or "<b>user</b>") have read and understood the following 
									terms and you signify your acceptance to the terms of use and other 
									policies contained on the app (including but not limited to Privacy 
									Policy and Cancellation and Refund Policy), the terms are binding 
									and enforceable against every person that uses the App.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3 style="font-size: 150%;">ORDERING</h3>
								<p class="justify-sm"> You enter into an agreement with Chops by placing an order via 
									our app or web app with regards to the delivery of the order and 
									forward it to the participating restaurant and subject to the 
									terms set herein, we shall make it possible for an order to be 
									sent to you. Any order that you place on the app is subject to 
									availability, delivery capacity, and acceptance both by us and 
									the restaurant. Once you placed an order on the app or web app, 
									we will send you a notification to confirm that we have received 
									it. This confirmation will be produced automatically and will 
									just give you confirmation of your order details so that you can 
									check that all details are correct. Once we have sent the 
									notification, we will check availability and delivery capacity. 
									If the restaurant you chose to order accepts the order it will 
									confirm it to Chops.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3 style="font-size: 150%;">DELIVERY</h3>
								<p class="justify-sm"> Factors such as traffic conditions and weather may occasionally 
									prevent us from achieving delivery targets in this regard. We 
									will inform you of the estimated delivery time for your item 
									before you place the order, but we will attempt delivery as 
									soon as possible; you must, therefore, be available to accept 
									delivery from the time you place the order. For a Scheduled 
									Delivery, we will tell you the time when the item is expected 
									to be delivered; you must be available to accept delivery.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3 style="font-size: 150%;">CANCELLATION</h3>
								<p class="justify-sm"> You reserve the right to cancel an order within any time 
									before the Restaurant Partner has started preparing the 
									food (a "<b>Started Order</b>"). If you wish to cancel an Order 
									before it becomes a Started Order, please contact us 
									immediately via our Application. If the Partner Restaurant 
									confirms the Order was not a Started Order, we will 
									refund your payment (excluding any discount, or Voucher 
									that was applied). If you cancel any order after it 
									becomes a Started Order, you will be charged 
									the full price for the Items.
								</p>
							</li>

									service we provide although we may remove the 
									content in contravention of these Terms as set. 
									If we do decide to moderate an interactive service,

									and normally provide you with a means of contacting.
